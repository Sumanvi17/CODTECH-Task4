The objective of this project is to perform Python Program on simple calculator.The aim is it should prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.


Key Activities:
   - Planned and designed a library management system.
   - Developed classes for library items (`Book`, `Magazine`, `DVD`) and a `Library` class for management.
   - Built a menu-driven interface for user interaction.
   - Tested functionality like adding, checking out, returning items, and searching.


Technologies Used:
   - Python 
   - datetime module for managing due dates and fines.


Features:
   - Add and manage items (Books, Magazines, DVDs).
   - Check out and return items with overdue fine calculation.
   - Search for items by title, author, or category.
   - Simple console-based user interface.
     

Key Insights:
   - Object-oriented design ensures modularity and scalability.
   - Fine calculations and due dates use Python's `datetime` module.
   - Easy to extend with additional features or item types.


Benefits:

1. Simplifies library operations.
2. Tracks item availability and overdue fines automatically.
